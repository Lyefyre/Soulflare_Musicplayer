## 1. Features ##

Soulflare can currently only play one pre-defined song. This is intended behaviour. The song is simply named "hip" and can be played by pressing the "play" button.
The pause button will pause the current song and memorizes the position. To resume playing from that position, press the play button.

The stop button will stop the current song without memorizing the song's position.

## 2. Bugs ##

"Pause" will sometimes remember the current position even when "stop" is being pressed, causing to play the song from it's memorized position, rather than from start.
